EETS was founded in 1864 by Frederick James Furnivall, with the help of Richard Morris, Walter Skeat,
and others, to bring the mass of unprinted Early English literature within the reach of students. It was
also intended to provide accurate texts from which the New (later Oxford) English Dictionary could quote;
the ongoing work on the revision of that Dictionary is still heavily dependent on the Society's editions,
as are the Middle English Dictionary and the Toronto Dictionary of Old English. In 1867 an Extra Series was
started, intended to contain texts already printed but not in satisfactory or readily obtainable editions;
this series was discontinued in 1921, and from then on all the Society's editions, apart from the handful
in the Supplementary Series described above, were listed and numbered as part of the Original Series. In
all the Society has now published some 475 volumes; all except for a very small number (mostly of editions
superseded within the series) are available in print. The early history of the Society is only traceable in
outline: no details about nineteenth-century membership are available, and the secretarial records of the
early twentieth century were largely lost during the second world war. By the 1950s a very large number of
the Society's editions were out of print, and finances allowed for only a very limited reprinting programme.
Around 1970 an advantageous arrangement was agreed with an American reprint firm to make almost all the volumes
available once more whilst maintaining the membership discounts. Though this arrangement was superseded towards
the end of the twentieth century and the cost of reprinting has reverted to the Society, as a result of the effort
then it has proved possible to keep the bulk of the list in print.

Many comparable societies, with different areas of interest, were founded in the nineteenth century (several of them
also by Furnivall); not all have survived, and few have produced as many valuable volumes as EETS. The Society's success
continues to depend very heavily on the loyalty of members, and especially on the energy and devotion of a series of
scholars who have been involved with the administration of the Society - the amount of time and effort spent by those
who over the years have filled the role of Editorial Secretary is immeasurable. Plans for publications for the coming
years are well in hand: there are a number of important texts which should be published within the next five years. At
present, notably because of the efforts of a series of Executive and Membership Secretaries, the Society's finances are
in reasonable shape; but certain trends give concern to the Council. The Society's continuance is dependent on two factors:
the first is obviously the supply of scholarly editions suitable to be included in its series; the second is on the
maintenance of subscriptions and sales of volumes at a level which will cover the printing and distribution costs of
the new and reprinted books. The normal copyright laws cover the Society's volumes. All enquiries about large scale
reproduction, whether by photocopying or on the internet, should be directed to the Executive Secretary in the first
instance. The Society's continued usefulness depends on its editors and on its ability to maintain its (re)printing
programme - and that depends on those who traditionally have become members of the Society. We hope you will maintain
your membership, and will encourage both the libraries you use and also other individuals to join. Membership conveys
many benefits for you, and for the wider academic community concerned for the understanding of medieval texts.
